Final Project for game development 50


Items for this project

Star Power up
I created a star object that appears from blocks collided with
The star creates a flag for the player that powers them up by icnreasing their speed, making them invicible, allowing them to kill normally unkillable aliens
The music allow speeds up twice as fast during the players star power up period


Mushrooms and health
I also introduced varying health to the game
So snails now only do a certain amount fo damage and your health level is displayed in the top left corner
mushrooms appear from blocks when collided with and they replenish health when you need it


Pink aliens
The pink aliens where quite a chore and are not as intelligent as I was planning
I ran in to some simple issues that took a lot more time than I hoped
These are basically deadly aliens that the player cannot kill unless he is in star power up mode
they are an entity themselves. They chase the player and unlike snails they jump over obstacles in pursuit of the player

I was on my way to implementing them throwing projectiles but ran in to some fatal errors that delayed me too much


I am hoping my video with no sound is okay I tried to explain everything in this read me

I did a long sample of play hoping to demonstrate
